## Coursework Assignment: Advanced Data Modelling

This repository contains the coursework assignment for the module CI6320 Advanced Data Modelling. The assignment was completed by Ranuga Disansa Belpa Gamage (Student ID: E112691) under the guidance of Mr. W A D B C Goonatillaka, the module leader.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment is divided into two parts:

1. **Part A**: This section explores the concepts of data modelling, focusing on the Relational Data Model (RDM), Object-Oriented Data Model (OODM), and Object-Relational Data Model (ORDM). It includes a detailed analysis of each model's history, core principles, and characteristics, followed by a comparison table and critical discussion on real-world application scenarios.

2. **Part B**: This section involves setting up a development environment and implementing a Library Management System (LMS) using Oracle SQL. It includes detailed SQL scripts for creating user-defined types, tables, inserting data, and retrieving information for publications, books, journals, members, loans, and additional features like altering tables and creating views.
